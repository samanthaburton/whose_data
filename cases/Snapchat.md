## Do I legally own the data this org has about me?
### Unclear


## Can I see all the data they have about me, for free?
### Yes...
_" If you need to access, update, or delete other personal information that we may have, you can put in a request "https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/downloadmydata""_

### But...
_" We may reject a request for a number of reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users, requires technical efforts that are disproportionate to the request, is repetitive, or is unlawful."_
