# Contributing to Whose Data?
Thanks so much for your interest in contributing! 

***Whose Data?* is an open source project that aims to make it easier for Canadians to answer key questions about who owns -- and what options we have to control -- data collected about us** via common online (eg. social media platforms) and offline (eg. health records) activities.

As an open source project, we need people like you to help grow and improve. If you want it to help make it easier for Canadians to find out who owns our data, thereâ€™s something you can do to help.

## First things first

When you join, please respect the code of conduct in all interactions on and offline.
