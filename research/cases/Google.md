## Do I legally own the data this org has about me?
### Yes
"Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours" ([Google.ca Terms of Service](https://www.google.ca/policies/terms/regional.html))

### But...
By agreeing to the Terms of Service (which you must do, to use Google services) **you give Google a worldwide license to use any data or content you upload to their services**, which allows them to do a broad range of things including using your data or content to promote the company's services.

"When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. 

The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. 

This license continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to Google Maps)." ([Google.ca Terms of Service](https://www.google.ca/policies/terms/regional.html))
