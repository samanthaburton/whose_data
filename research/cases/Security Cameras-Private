# Security cameras on private property
Most Canadian privacy laws require private spaces to post a "[clear and understandable notice](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/surveillance-and-monitoring/gl_vs_080306/)" about the use of video surveillance on the premises, in a place where you'll see it _before you enter_. This is to give you the option of not entering if you don't want to be recorded. The notice should also include contact information, in case you have questions or want to request images related to you.

Covert video surveillance -- that is where you don't know you're being filmed -- is only permitted under Canadian law in situations [where certain requirements are met](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/surveillance-and-monitoring/gd_cvs_20090527/).

## Do I legally own the data this org has about me? 
### Unclear

## Can I see all the data they have about me, for free?
### Yes
You legally have the right to request access to any video footage of you, so long as this is possible without infringing on the privacy rights of other people in the footage.

"Individuals have the right to access images relating to them.  When disclosing recordings to individuals who appear in them, the organization must ensure that identifying information about any other individuals on the recording is not revealed. This can be done through technologies that mask identity." ([Office of the Privacy Commissioner](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/surveillance-and-monitoring/gl_vs_080306/))
