## Do I legally own the data this org has about me? 
### Yes
"You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your [privacy](https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy) and [application](https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications) settings." ([Facebook Statement of Rights and Responsibilities](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php))

### But...
**(1)** By agreeing to the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (which you must do, to use Facebook) **you give Facebook a license to use any IP protected data or content (eg. photos/video) you share on Facebook, royalty-free**. You can control some of this via your [privacy](https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy) and [application](https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications) settings. This license ends when you delete the content from Facebook -- _unless_ someone else still has the content on their profile and they haven't deleted it. ([See Facebook Statement of Rights and Responsibilities](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php))

**(2)** Facebook also likely has data about you that _you do not own_. Their policy states that you own all the content and information that you choose to post to the platform -- but it's unclear whether you also own data about you that Facebook collects in other ways. 

Namely, [Facebook collects data about people outside of its own site](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-off-facebook/) (whether or not you have a Facebook account) outside of its own site using tools such as embedded "like" and "share" buttons and code like [Facebook Pixel](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/742478679120153). These tools are intended to help website and app developers target ads and track clicks, and they also send data back to Facebook, which the company uses to enhance its own advertising and other services. 

While [still a grey area](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/the-most-important-exchange-of-the-zuckerberg-hearing/557795/), it appears that you do not own the data Facebook collects about you in this way.

## Can I see all the data they have about me, for free?
### Yes
If you have a Facebook account, you can
- Look to [Activity Log](https://www.facebook.com/help/437430672945092) for a list of all your posts and activity since you joined Facebook
- [Download all](https://www.facebook.com/help/302796099745838) the personal data that Facebook holds about you
- See how Facebook categorizes you for advertising purposes by checking out your [Ad Preferences](https://www.facebook.com/help/247395082112892)

### But...
As mentioned above, Facebook collects data about you -- such as your interactions with other websites and apps -- in addition to the content and information that you choose to post to the platform. 

At this time, it does not appear that you are able to see the data Facebook collects about you in this way. However, some [Facebook users](https://twitter.com/halhod/status/984112272321761280) are currently trying to access this data about them.
